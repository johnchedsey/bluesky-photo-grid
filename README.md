# Bluesky Photo Grid 

Create a static website photo gallery from a Bluesky account using S3 (and optionally CloudFront), GitHub Pages, or any CDN you can rsync from a local directory to. Cron it to run as often as you want (it wont actually update files unless your Bluesky changes) and customize the look and feel as desired!

Uses [LightGallery](https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightGallery) for the UI.

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I would love code for other CDNs. Should this support sources beyond Bluesky?
